# GROUPS

Groups is a pluggable tool on Sunbird that enables users to create virtual groups of users, assign assets to the Group, as well as review the asset progress of the users.

Groups component comprises the Groups Service (APIs) as well as the Groups UX tools. Groups UX is still part of Sunbrid-Ed.
